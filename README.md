# Eat-Da-Burger-Sequelized
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat and customer's name who ate.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

App stores every burger in a MySQL database using Sequelize, whether devoured or not.

The app uses npm packages express, express-handlebars, mysql, and orm.
